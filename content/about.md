# Education

In 2020, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, followed the next year by a Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Cybersecurity, both from the [Fundamental Problem Faculty](https://wppt.pwr.edu.pl) of the [Wrocław University of Science and Technology (Politechnika Wrocławska)](https://pwr.edu.pl).

# Work
I started programming professionally in March 2019, and after graduating in 2021 it became full time. So far, I've primarily worked in e-commerce, with PHP-based applications.

My current role is a Senior Backend Developer / Team Lead. My everyday responsibilities include:
- Programming (maintaining and improving Shopware projects and plugins) and estimating effort
- Troubleshooting: Analyzing and solving difficult issues
- Guiding and advising other team members as a Team Lead
- Organizing the work in projects and making technical decisions as a Tech Lead
- Handling some of the DevOps work (Bitbucket Pipelines, Gitlab CI, Docker, Jenkins)
- Managing parts of the company's infrastructure (e.g. company GitLab and VPN)
- Reviving legacy projects (also known as "doing magic")

My tech stack revolves around the PHP-Symfony-Shopware trinity, as most of my work is closely related to Shopware. By extension, I also work a lot with Bash, Shopware-customized Vue.js, Twig, and relational databases (MySQL, MariaDB)

# Other technologies

For my personal projects, I typically choose Python 3. I also keep trying to learn some Swift in my free time. I've briefly worked with Magento 1 and 2.

During my time at the university, I've done some programming in: C, C++, C#, Java, Julia, Kotlin, Haskell, Prolog.

# Other facts
- I enjoy games of all kinds: board games, video games, pen and paper RPGs.
- I accumulate books. I mean, I read books, but due to some mysterious circumstances the growth of my to-read outpaces my reading speed.
- When it comes to sports, I swim and play tennis. I also love indoor bouldering, though my city lacks a nice gym.
